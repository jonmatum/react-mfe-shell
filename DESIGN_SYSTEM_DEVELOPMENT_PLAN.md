# Design System Development Plan

A comprehensive, stage-by-stage plan for building a world-class design system library using Amazon Q, following DRY principles, atomic design, and modern technologies.

## Master Prompt Template for Amazon Q

Use this template when starting any stage of development:

```
You are helping me build a world-class design system library following these core principles:

CORE PRINCIPLES:
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Maximize code reusability and eliminate duplication
- Atomic Design: Components organized as Atoms ‚Üí Molecules ‚Üí Organisms ‚Üí Templates ‚Üí Pages
- Type Safety: Strict TypeScript with comprehensive type definitions
- Accessibility First: WCAG AA compliance in all components
- Performance: Tree-shaking, lazy loading, optimized bundle sizes
- Consistency: Unified API patterns across all components

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling with design tokens
- Vite for build tooling and development
- Vitest for testing (90%+ coverage requirement)
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality

ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Design tokens as single source of truth
- Compound components for complex interactions
- Polymorphic components (as prop support)
- Theme system (light/dark/system modes)
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Micro frontend compatibility

CURRENT PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Base path: /Users/jonmatum/Code/jonmatum/react-mfe-shell
- Existing atomic structure in src/components/
- Settings management with SettingsProvider
- Established build pipeline with tsup

STAGE-BY-STAGE APPROACH:
When I request work on a specific stage, provide:
1. Detailed implementation plan
2. Complete code examples with TypeScript
3. Tailwind CSS classes following design tokens
4. Test cases for 90%+ coverage
6. Integration instructions with existing codebase

RESPONSE FORMAT:
- Start with implementation overview
- Provide complete, production-ready code
- Include comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Show Tailwind CSS utility usage
- Add accessibility attributes (ARIA, roles, etc.)
- Include error handling and edge cases
- Provide testing examples
- End with integration checklist

Please confirm you understand these requirements and are ready to help me build this design system stage by stage.
