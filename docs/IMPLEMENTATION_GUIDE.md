# MFE App Shell Implementation Guide

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Setup & Foundation

1. **Create New Project Structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir mfe-appshell-v2
   cd mfe-appshell-v2
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Use AI to Generate Core Files**
   - Copy sections 1-3 of the prompt (Project Overview, Quality Targets, Architecture)
   - Ask AI: "Generate the project setup, package.json, and TypeScript configuration based on this specification"

3. **Generate Design System**
   - Copy the "Enhanced Token System" section
   - Ask AI: "Generate the complete design system with tokens, variants, and theme configuration"

### Phase 2: Component Generation

4. **Generate Atomic Components**
   - Copy the Atoms section from the prompt
   - Ask AI: "Generate all 25+ atomic components with the specified features and test coverage"
   - Generate 5-10 components at a time to avoid overwhelming responses

5. **Generate Molecules**
   - Copy the Molecules section
   - Ask AI: "Generate the 12+ molecule components with integration tests"

6. **Generate Organisms**
   - Copy the Organisms section
   - Ask AI: "Generate the organism components with full functionality"

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality

7. **Generate Test Infrastructure**
   - Copy the "Comprehensive Testing Strategy" section
   - Ask AI: "Generate the complete testing setup, utilities, and example tests"

8. **Generate Performance Optimizations**
   - Copy the "Performance Optimization" section
   - Ask AI: "Generate the bundle optimization, code splitting, and memory management utilities"

### Phase 4: Documentation & Polish

9. **Generate Documentation**
   - Ask AI: "Generate comprehensive README, API documentation, and usage examples"

10. **Generate Build Configuration**
    - Copy the NPM Package section
    - Ask AI: "Generate the complete build configuration, tsup setup, and package.json"

## AI Prompting Tips

### For Best Results:

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "generate everything", ask for specific sections
2. **Provide Context**: Always include the relevant section from the main prompt
3. **Request Tests**: Always ask for tests alongside components
4. **Ask for TypeScript**: Specify "with full TypeScript types and interfaces"
5. **Request Documentation**: Ask for JSDoc comments and usage examples

### Example Prompts:

**For Components:**
```
Based on this specification: [paste atoms section]

Generate the Button component with:
- All 8 variants specified
- Loading states and accessibility
- Complete TypeScript interfaces
- Comprehensive test suite with 98%+ coverage
- JSDoc documentation
- Usage examples
```

**For Design System:**
```
Based on this design system specification: [paste tokens section]

Generate:
- Complete design tokens with CSS custom properties
- Variant system using class-variance-authority
- Theme configuration with light/dark modes
- TypeScript types for all tokens
- Usage documentation
```

**For Testing:**
```
Based on this testing strategy: [paste testing section]

Generate:
- Complete test setup and configuration
- Testing utilities and custom renders
- Example component tests with all patterns
- Integration test examples
- Performance and accessibility test utilities
```

## Quality Checkpoints

After each phase, verify:

- [ ] All TypeScript types are properly defined
- [ ] Tests are passing with required coverage
- [ ] Components follow atomic design principles
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are met
- [ ] Performance targets are achieved
- [ ] Documentation is complete

## Troubleshooting

### If AI responses are incomplete:
- Ask for specific parts: "Continue with the remaining components"
- Break down requests into smaller chunks
- Ask for "the complete implementation" if something seems partial

### If code doesn't work:
- Ask AI to "fix any TypeScript errors in this code"
- Request "add missing imports and dependencies"
- Ask for "complete working example with all necessary setup"

### If tests fail:
- Ask AI to "generate working tests for this component"
- Request "fix the test setup and mocking"
- Ask for "complete test coverage for all component features"
